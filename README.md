# 30MFF Website


### Website Description

##### What is it

The website is where he showcase the 30MFF film. The website also provides information and access to other future projects such as the comic strips that we would be coming up with later in the future. the Website gives information about the people who made the 30MFF film which includes what year they are in, hobbies and much more. the website also contains information on the motivation that lead to the creation of the film.

##### The concept

The concept was to make a simple but expandable website that could house the 30MFF as well as more future projects and information on the people working on the varions projects. 

##### The Theme

The theme of the website would be simple images on top of a simple yellow background and white text. there would be a header on the top of every website telling about the main attraction of the site which is the 30MFF

##### Experiance

Simple and clean. you would know where everything is and what is being featured


### Implementing The Concept

##### Code
Most of the coding done was lernt from the teachings of the professor. some extra concepts were learnt form W3School and links provided by the professor 

##### Links

I decided to make the website accessable form navigational icons that would let the user visit other parts of the site

##### Video

The Video was taken from the CommLabs Website 

##### User Interaction

For the special user interaction I decided to make the comics appear when the user clicks on the arrow  

##### Images

All the Images are from google Images

##### Info Banners

For the info banner I decided on making 4 elements that would toghether make the entire banner. it would consist of picture of the people who worked on the project, name title, info text of each person and some decor for the picture. but you may see place holder images as respect for people keeping privacy on the picture

### Reflections and Evaluations

##### Did it live to The Expectation I Had

I think almost everthing that I thought of how the website would look like has come to be

##### What Made The Cut and What Did Not

I thought of some cool interactive and decor elements but my lack of understanding of JavaScripts stopped it from being implemented

##### Problems

The only major problem I had was with positioning. but I am certain with practice I will get the gist of it
