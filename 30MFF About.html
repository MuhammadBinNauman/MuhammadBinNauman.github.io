                What lead us to make the film. well we did not know that we had to make a film, we were having a normal class and the professor told us that we would be doing something creative. The creative thing was that we had to make the 30MFF in one hour. so i think that is the story in what got us to make the Film. on the concept of the film well we were to lazy to take the camera and try to record something cool. so we thought why not just record the zoom session and use it as the 30MFF. but we were to lazy to when get out of our seats so we came up with this concept of passing around things to make a insynch type of a video.
